<h1>The Best Movies According to Jonathan</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Army of the Dead</h3>
<p>This 2023 zombie movie stars Dave Bautista and is one of the heist movies that truly kept me guessing until the very end. </p>
<h3>Logan Lucky</h3>
<p>Heres yet another heist movie, this one stars Channing Tatum and Adam Driver, 
    which is appropriate because the movie has to do with stealing money from 
    a nascar event venue vault during the biggest race of the year. </p>
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>I stole this movie from the creator of the course because I'm lazy and i don't usually play favorites when it comes to movies :P </p>
